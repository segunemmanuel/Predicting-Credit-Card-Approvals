# Automatic Credit Card Approval Predictor

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for various reasons, such as high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning, and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains various features such as income level, loan balances, and credit report inquiries, as well as the target variable indicating whether the credit card application was approved or not.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.).
3. Run the provided code to train the machine learning model on the dataset.
4. Use the trained model to predict credit card approvals for new applications.
